# Everyday Maths

A collection of mathematical concepts that will help you navigate the deep, dark, murky digital ocean (and maybe the real ocean too). I hope I can explain these ideas in ways that anyone will understand.

- Bayes rule
- categories vs distributions
- common distributions: uniform, normal, Pareto (80/20 rule)
- compound interest
- correlation does not imply causation
- equilibria
- everything is graphs
- multiple factor analysis
- objective functions
- probability and risk
- stacks and queues
- theories of value

## Categories vs Continuums

There are two types of data: categorical and continuous. Categorical data can be separated into discrete bins (or categories), such as a light switch being on or off, or days of the week. Continuous data can be any point on a line, such as height and weight, temperature, or the passage of time.

Sometimes its not clear whether something is categorical or continuous. Take, for example, biological sex. We may think of sex as a binary category, male or female. This model seems to be correct 99% of the time, and even the underlying biological factor, i.e. whether you have XX chromosomes or XY chromosomes, seems to be categorical. But there are interesting exceptions. Some people have only one such chromosome, or three of them.
