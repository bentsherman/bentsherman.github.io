# Everyday Maths

A collection of mathematical concepts that will help you navigate the deep, dark, murky digital ocean (and maybe the real ocean too). I hope I can explain these ideas in ways that anyone will understand.

- Bayes rule
- categories vs distributions
- common distributions: uniform, normal, Pareto (80/20 rule)
- compound interest
- correlation does not imply causation
- equilibria
- everything is graphs
- multiple factor analysis
- objective functions
- probability and risk
- stacks and queues
- theories of value
