# God and Politics

*Epistemic status: work in progress*

I think a lot about my own political philosophy. I have a document somewhere in which I have tried to list out my opinions on a variety of political issues. Maybe one day I will share them here.

But at the end of the day, I cannot describe my politics separate from the fact that I am a Christian (a.k.a. Jesus follower, a.k.a. follower of "the way"), as my belief in God forms the foundation of everything else I believe.

Sharing your beliefs is a messy business. I think the problem is that people tend to conflate moral disapproval with hate or violent intent. I understand that these things have often gone together, but they don't have to. I may disapprove of some aspect of your lifestyle, but that does not mean that I hate you, or want to see you killed or otherwise punished.

The Bible does not command me to use the levers of government to punish sinners. In fact, it's quite the opposite:

> Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.
> Romans 13:1-2 (ESV)

I understand this passage to mean that God has appointed human authorities according to His will. They "play into His hands", whether they realize it or not, even if they do evil, because He put them in power. By submitting to the human authorities above me, I am really submitting to God, and if I defy those authorities, I also defy God.

Being an American, whose country was born out of rebellion, I confess that I am not very good at submitting to authority, and I fail at it often. I am thankful to God that His love covers my sins.

But my point is that my beliefs on what is right and wrong do not imply political action. The Bible condemns many behaviors -- killing, stealing, lying, adultery, drunkenness, homosexuality, and so on. If you ask me *what I think* about something, whether it is right or wrong, I will answer you based on my understanding of what the Bible says about it. But if you ask me *what should be done* about it, well... what do I gain by using the institutions of man to punish sinners? Only God can judge, not man. So I do not intend to do anything about sin, at least, not through the institutions of man.

Why are some sins (e.g. murder) illegal while others (e.g. homosexuality) are not? Put simply, the law is created by man-made institutions, so what is lawful or unlawful is completely separate from what is sinful. I think murder is illegal because everyone agrees that it should be. I think everyone used to agree that homosexuality should be illegal, so it was, but over time people changed their mind, and so today it isn't. Our laws are decided by our particular man-made institution, i.e. the democratic process, i.e. people voting.

Democracy is an interesting development for Christians. Submitting to authority is simple enough when you are ruled by a king -- maybe not *easy*, but *simple* -- but when you hold the reigns of authority alongside everyone else, how do you proceed? You can submit to the president, to the democratic proces, but how should you vote?

I don't really know. My intuition is that maybe it doesn't really matter against the backdrop of eternity, or maybe the Holy Spirit guides each person individually. In practice, I guess I fallback to some sort of quasi-utilitarian mode -- mostly voting for what I think will improve things like "human rights" and "standards of living", occasionally voting for what I think is simply "the right thing to do". Because in practice, I do want to see peoples' lives made better, even if it does nothing for their eternal soul. What can I say? I'm only human.
