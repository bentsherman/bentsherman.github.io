# Workflows All the Way Down

TODO

Workflows at the level of hardware, software, and people.

Imperative vs functional/reactive programming.

Object-oriented vs procedural programming, data-oriented design.

How to navigate an object-oriented codebase (classes as operators, input fields vs intermediate fields, method fragmentation)

Prefect's idea of positive vs negative engineering.

Gradual adoption of ideas from functional programming: maps, filters, reductions, promises, maybe monads.

Future of programming (procedural, functional, Rust)

Different ways to visualize code, multi-layer dataflow graph

Interactive programming environments, incorporate batch vs streaming article?

Data science frontends
- Excel + SQL + Jupyter + Figma
- Enso
- Hex

Theory of computation, language models (separate from semiconductor technology)
