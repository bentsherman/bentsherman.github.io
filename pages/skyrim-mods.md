# Skyrim Modding Research

I have been a fan of The Elder Scrolls since I was in elementary school. To the extent that I am a gamer, it's mostly because I have sunk thousands of hours into these games. That is why I continue to play these games 10, 15, 20 years after they are released, and I'll probably keep playing them for the rest of my life.

That being said, I have never gone deep with my own mod setup for Skyrim. I installed a few mods from the Steam workshop a few years ago, mostly for a gag playthrough where dragons where trains, mudcrabs had top hats, and my primary weapons were a lightsaber and a Dwemer longrifle. And every time an NPC said something about arrows to the knee, or sweetrolls, or the Cloud District... they received "divine punishment". And a few quest mods, but they mostly turned out to be just okay. Now that I was finally settled in my new home, I decided I was ready to pursue a new mod setup in earnest.

And I must say, Skyrim modding has come an incredibly long way. It has reached heights I did not expect. I was overwhelmed by the vast sea of _really good mods_ out there. Fortunately, I just completed a dissertation, so I was experienced in carrying out long bouts of research. I endeavoured to find the best mods in every category and build my own ultimate modded Skyrim.

Consider this page a "living research report", in which I maintain my knowledge of mods across the various aspects of Skyrim, as well as some notes about modding Skyrim in general, like how to determine whether two mods might conflict, how to find patches, etc.
