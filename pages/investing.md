How to make your money work for you, or whatever

_Epistemic status: basically done, definitely not financial advice_

## Introduction

In 2019, a friend and mentor of mine recommended a book to me called _Rich Dad Poor Dad_. The insights in this book seem so simple in retrospect, but it was really impactful when I read it. It changed my outlook on life. The book's premise, in a nutshell, is:

1. Poor people make money by working, rich people make money by investing
2. Invest money to generate passive income
3. When your monthly passive income matches your monthly expenses, you will be rich

Before I read this book, I didn't think much about money. I knew I would earn plenty of money as a software engineer, and I knew I was good at saving it, but I didn't have any plans beyond that. This book felt like the final piece of the puzzle -- I would invest the extra money into things that generate passive income, and then I would retire early and live off of my passive income.

And so I took the plunge into the whole new world of investing (new to me). I'd like to share with you what I've found so far.

## Investing Strategies

There are basically two ways to earn money: work (labor) or invest (capital). Although we tend to see labor and capital as opposing forces, many people are simultaneously laborers and capitalists, but we'll get to that later.

The worker tries to earn the highest income for the least amount of work. The investor tries to earn the highest percent yield on their investment. These two strategies are very different and therefore require different ways of thinking.

I won't go deep into the worker's strategy here, since most people work for a living and know the strategies for their particular field. Let's talk about the most common investment strategies out there.

*Note: Some of the following information (e.g. terminology, tax rules) is specific to the US. Please review the rules in your own country before you invest.*

### Bank account

Deposit your money in a bank, the bank uses some of it for mortgages and personal loans, and you get a piece of the interest.

- Many different types of accounts: checking, savings, money market, certificates of deposit (CDs). Interest rates range from 0 - 5% but depend mostly on current FOMC interest rates.

- Banks are typically insured up to $250,000 per account.

- Interest payments are taxed as ordinary income.

*Strategy:* Use a checking account for personal expenses, and a high yield savings account for emergency fund and dormant capital. Don’t bother with CDs, they aren’t worth it.

### Public securities

A security is a piece of paper (or a record in a database, you get the idea) that points to something with "real" (lol) value. Technically everything in this list could be considered a security (even money -- it's a form of debt!), but here I'm referring to publicly-traded securities. "Public" just means that the securities are traded through public exchanges that anyone can use.

Securities fall under three basic categories:

- Debt (e.g. money (told you!), bonds)
- Equity (e.g. stocks)
- Derivatives (e.g. futures, options)

Debt is where you lend someone money and then they pay you interest (e.g. 5% per year) until they return the amount you lent them (the principal). Equity is where you own a fraction of an asset (e.g. a company), and sometimes it pays you dividends (kinda like interest you earn on a bank account). Derivatives are contracts that *derive* their value from the performance of an underlying asset; they are known to bring great wealth and crash entire economies.

- You can try to buy low and sell high on a daily basis (day trading) or buy and hold in order to benefit from long-term compound growth (retirement fund).

- If you hold a security for less than one year, the profit is taxed as ordinary income.

- If you hold a security for more than one year, the profit is taxed as capital gains (much lower rates than ordinary income).

- If you’re not sure where to invest, you can invest in a fund (e.g. mutual fund, index fund, ETF) which will include a mixture of securities. Funds tend to be more stable because they are diversified across many different assets. There are many funds out there, so you can choose funds that have the right amount of focus vs diversification for you.

- Don’t be scared by recessions. Remember: buy low, sell high. If the value of a security goes down, it may be better to wait for it to go back up rather than sell at a loss. Stocks tend to go up in the long run, unless e.g. the company goes bankrupt.

*Strategy:* Decide how much passive income you want to have when you retire, and from that derive the required monthly contribution. Don’t bother with day trading unless you want to do it professionally.

### Private equity

Public equity is traded through public exchanges that anyone can use. Private equity is traded directly between individuals, and not just anyone can participate -- you have to know the right people, and you probably have to have a lot of money too. This distinction exists because public securities are more strictly regulated and considered "safer".

When a company is born, it usually starts by selling equity through a "private placement" (e.g. private equity) in order to raise money. There are two basic types of private placements:

- 506(b): Available to accredited investors and up to 35 non-accredited investors. No public advertising allowed.
- 506(c): Available to accredited investors only. Public advertising allowed.

To qualify as an accredited investor, you have to either (1) be a financial institution, (2) be a licensed "securities representative", (3) make at least $200,000 a year ($300,000 if you're married), or (4) have a net worth of at least $1 million (not including your house). You probably aren't (1) or (2), so basically you have to be rich. The SEC figures that if you're rich then you probably know how to manage your money.

So if you aren't rich, you'll have to find 506(b) offerings from people whom you know personally. Basically, you have to meet people and get to know them. It's quite tedious compared to trading on the stock market, but in reality it is necessary whether you are accredited or not. The performance of the business will depend greatly on its operators, so you should get to know them before you give them your money.

*Strategy:* Depends heavily on your goals and which market sector(s) you are in.

### Private lending

In the [previous section](#private-equity) I explained the difference between public equity and private equity. Well, the same dichotomy exists for debt. Publicly-traded debt includes things like municipal, corporate, and government bonds. Other kinds of debt, like mortgages and personal loans, are usually facilitated by banks. But you can also just give someone a loan! That is called private lending.

The challenge with lending, of course, is knowing whether the person to whom you lend money (the debtor) will repay you (the creditor). The reason why banks do most of the lending is that they have the resources to (1) vett loan applications and (2) absorb any losses from loans that are never repaid (defaulted). So if you do get into private lending, you should be confident that you will be able to do better than the banks.

Private lending can be lucrative in certain niche markets where banks are less likely to invest (e.g. house flipping). These loans typically have interest rates because they are more risky, but if you have specific knowledge about e.g. house flipping in your local area, you might be able to find opportunities that the banks missed.

*Strategy:* Don't bother with it unless you really know what you're doing.

### Tax lien certificates

When someone fails to pay their property taxes, the local government may put a "lien" on the property. Sometimes the government will auction off the lien in the form of a "tax lien certificate", in order to recover the tax revenue. The property owner then pays their property taxes to the certificate holder, with interest. The interest rate is usually very high, and in some cases the certificate holder might be able to foreclose on the property if they aren't repaid after a certain amount of time.

It's like a special form of debt derived from unpaid property taxes. The rules for this one vary by state, so do your own research.

*Strategy:* Don't bother with it unless you really know what you're doing.

### Real estate

Real estate is that sector of the economy pertaining to land and the buildings on it. Because [land is central](./land-is-the-problem.md) to everything we do, real estate represents a huge portion of global investment, and thereby deserves its own section.

There are several types of real estate: residential, commercial, and industrial. Within residential, there is also single-family (houses) and multifamily (apartments). Real estate investments can be structured as debt (mortgages, hard money lending) or equity (REITs, private placements) or both, and they can provide returns in the form of cash flow ("core") or appreciation ("value-add") or both. Investments can be short-term (house flipping) or long-term (buy and hold).

Real estate markets are hyper-local -- you *must* understand the specific cities and even neighborhoods in which you are investing, or else you will get gipped by someone who knows the market better than you. Just ask [Zillow](https://www.wsj.com/articles/zillows-shuttered-home-flipping-business-lost-881-million-in-2021-11644529656)!

*Strategy:* Find a niche and focus on it. I am focused on multifamily value-add deals in parts of the country where I have lived. I invest as a limited partner in private offerings from experienced operators whom I know and trust. I pursue value-add deals because I want to grow my wealth through appreciation while I'm young, then I will transition to "core" deals when I'm old and just want the cash flow. My point is, I have found a particular niche within real estate that aligns with my values and goals, so I'm going to get good at evaluating deals within this niche rather than being spread thin across many different kinds of real estate.

### Land speculation

Land -- they don't make it anymore. So if you buy land today, chances are it will be worth more tomorrow (or in ten years). That is land speculation -- buy some land, wait for its value to increase, then sell it.

I only mention land speculation in order to argue that [you shouldn't do it](./land-is-the-problem.md) because it is 100% rent-seeking behavior. You're just leeching off of people who would do something more productive (i.e. literally anything) with that land.

### Cryptocurrency

Is it the next stage of civilization or just the latest scam? Public opinion on this question is probably correlated with the price of Bitcoin. One day, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin might become actual currencies that are used for everyday transactions, but for now they are mostly just investment vehicles.

Bitcoin is digital fiat -- its value is derived from people's belief in it. The US dollar is also fiat, but its value is backed by the full faith and credit (and military) of the US government.

Ethereum is similar to Bitcoin, but with some differences that I find interesting.

- The Ethereum network supports executable code (called "smart contracts") and tokens, which together have laid the foundation for decentralized financial markets. Fungible tokens (ERC-20) can be used to issue new currencies or shares in a company. For example, stablecoins are fungible tokens that track the value of a real currency (usually the US dollar) and are backed by assets like Ether (e.g. DAI) or actual US dollars (e.g. USDC). Non-fungible tokens (ERC-721) can be used to issue certificates of ownership or authenticity, like the deed to your house or car, or an expensive JPEG that anyone can copy anyway.

- The Ethereum network recently transitioned its consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (the same used by Bitcoin) to proof-of-stake. The "consensus mechanism" is how the network maintains the public ledger of all transactions in a decentralized manner. Proof-of-work is extremely computationally inefficient compared to traditional financial systems because it is decentralized. Proof-of-stake reduces the computation (and thereby the energy consumption) by over 99%.

  So what's the catch? Proof-of-stake makes some compromises on security that in a small number of extreme edge cases could maybe lead to a security breach. But I think we won't really know the magnitude of this risk until proof-of-stake has been running at scale for many years.
  
In any case, between smart contracts, proof-of-stake, and other scaling solutions like L2 networks, Ethereum might eventually be able to challenge traditional finance in a way that Bitcoin won't.

Do any of these tokens or networks have any fundamental value? How are people benefiting from exchanging tokens or taking out crypto loans? I suspect most of it is speculation, arbitrage, and leveraged speculation and arbitrage. Maybe there are some farmers in undeveloped nations who are putting their wealth into crypto instead of extra livestock, and borrowing against their crypto at 10-20% interest because it's still way better than any loan they could get in meatspace. Maybe some folks are putting their money into crypto to protect it against hyperinflation (e.g. Venezuela). But it's hard to know for certain because everything is decentralized and anonymous, so without hard evidence I remain skeptical.

I think the same rules apply to crypto as with any investment: convenience and safety cost extra, the rate of return is proportional to the risk, only invest as much as you are willing to lose. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) will charge a higher percentage on trades than [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), and pay a lower percentage on yield than [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), but Coinbase is also safer and more convenient. If a website advertises returns that are way higher than those of the S&P 500 or a good money market account, it's either very risky or just a pyramid scheme.

*Strategy:* Consider dollar-cost averaging with BTC, ETH, and *maybe* a [DeFi index](https://indexcoop.com/defi-pulse-index-dpi). Don't bother with anything else unless you *really* know what you're doing.

### Entrepreneurship

Also known as "side hustles", "being your own boss", etc. I only include this one to point out that it's not really a form of investing or passive income. It's just another kind of work! It may be relatively unique, and it may be high-risk high-reward, but make no mistake -- you will have to work your tail off if you want to be successful at building companies.

When it comes to software and the Internet, there are some businesses that can become profitable with minimal setup and regular maintenance, because software can scale to many more people than physical goods or services. Some common examples include affiliate marketing, e-commerce websites, and online ad agencies. But if any given business idea is at the stage where people are selling courses about it on YouTube, probably most of that digital gold has already been mined.

I'm not saying you shouldn't be an entrepreneur or have a side hustle. The world needs people who can bring together workers, investors, and consumers into positive feedback loops. I'm saying that you should understand that it's not a form of passive investing.

### Tax-advantaged savings accounts

There are ways to invest your money and pay less taxes than you normally would, by saving for things that the government wants to encourage. Mostly retirement, health expenses, and college.

*Note: The following points are just summaries, please read the fine print before you invest.*

- 401(k): Let your employer redirect some of your wages into a managed investment fund. Withdraw once you are 59 ½ years old. Subject to yearly contribution limits. Can be traditional (deposits are deducted from taxable income, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income) or Roth (deposits are not deducted, withdrawals are not taxed). Some employers will match your contribution up to some limit.

- Individual retirement account (IRA): Deposit money and invest it in whatever. Withdraw once you are 59 ½ years old. Subject to yearly contribution limits (much lower than a 401(k)). Can be traditional (deposits are deducted from taxable income, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income) or Roth (deposits are not deducted, withdrawals are not taxed).

- Health savings account (HSA): Deposit money and invest it in whatever. Deposits are deducted from your taxable income. Withdrawals are not taxed if they are used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Can only be used with a high-deductible health plan, subject to yearly contribution limits.

- 529 plan: Deposit money and invest it in whatever. Withdrawals are not taxed if they are used to pay for qualified educational expenses.

- Cash value life insurance (7702 private plan): Pay monthly premiums into an insurance policy with a "cash value" and "death benefit". The cash value earns interest each year. You can borrow against the cash value and pay it back with simple interest, and at your own pace because the death benefit is the collateral.

## Summary

What's the point of all this? What is the goal of investing?

The goal is whatever you want it to be, and it doesn't have to be about achieving the highest return or reaching a certain level of wealth. In fact, don't think about money at all when defining your gaols. Start with the actual things you want to do in your life. You want a big house and a fast car? You want to feed the hungry and shelter the homeless in your community? You want to retire early? What would you do if you had all of that free time? None of these goals have anything to do with money, not directly anyway. Money is just a piece of paper or a number in a database. It is a means to an end, not an end in itself.

Wealth is a mindset, not just an amount of money. You can have very little money and still be wealthy, or you can have lots of money and still be poor. A wealthy person seeks opportunities, takes calculated risks, and finds lessons and motivation from failures. So, before you go out seeking wealth, seek first a wealthy mindset.

My strategies for wealth:

- **Job:** Find a niche where you can be uniquely valuable. Your disposable income is your capital.
- **Stocks and bonds:** Dollar-cost averaging. 80% US stocks, 10% international stocks, 10% US bonds.
- **Real estate:** Multifamily value-add syndications with experienced operators.
- **Cryptocurrency:** Dollar-cost averaging. 60% ETH, 20% BTC, 20% DPI.
- **Tax-advantaged accounts:** Use traditional 401(k) when employer matching is available, otherwise use traditional IRA. Use HSA when using a high-deductible health plan.
- **Credit cards:** Use credit cards to maintain high credit score only, to ensure favorable interest rates on future loans. Never carry a balance.
