How to make your money work for you, or whatever

_Epistemic status: work in progress_

## I

In 2019, a friend and mentor of mine recommended a book to me called _Rich Dad Poor Dad_. The insights in this book seem so simple in retrospect, but it was really impactful when I read it. It changed my outlook on life. The book's premise, in a nutshell, is:

1. Poor people make money by working, rich people make money by investing
2. Invest money to generate passive income
3. When your monthly passive income matches your monthly expenses, you will be rich

Before I read this book, I didn't think much about money. I knew I would earn plenty of money as a software engineer, and I knew I was good at saving it, but I didn't have any plans beyond that. This book felt like the final piece of the puzzle -- I would invest the extra money into things that generate passive income, and then I would retire early and live off of my passive income.

And so I took the plunge into the whole new world of investing (new to me). I'd like to share with you what I've found so far.

There are basically two ways to earn money: work (labor) or invest (capital). Although we tend to see labor and capital as opposing forces, many people are simultaneously laborers and capitalists, but we'll get to that later.

The worker tries to earn the highest income for the least amount of work. The investor tries to earn the highest percent yield on their investment. These two strategies are very different and therefore require differents ways of thinking.

I won't go very far into the worker's strategy here, since most people work for a living and know the strategies for their particular field. Let's talk about the most common investment opportunities out there.
