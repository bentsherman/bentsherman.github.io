# Land is the Problem

**Why is there wealth inequality? Why do economic recessions happen? Why do wars happen? Why is...**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Whoa there, slow down. You just asked a bunch of complicated questions. Why don't we start with something simpler, like the definition of wealth. </p>

**Okay... what is wealth?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> When human labor is applied to the natural world, producing something tangible that is the object of human desire, that thing is wealth. </p>

**What are some examples of wealth?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Teddy bears. Tesla roadsters. Candy canes. Young adult vampire romance novels. Lego bricks. Gold that you've mined. Fish that you've caught. Deer that you've hunted. Cool looking rocks you picked up on your morning walk. </p>

**What are some things that aren't wealth?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Money. Bitcoin. Stocks and bonds. Sl... </p>

**Wait, *what?* Money isn't wealth?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> That's right. Money is only a claim on wealth. It is certainly <em>valuable</em>, but it is not wealth. </p>

**Well what makes something valuable?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_value_(economics)">many different theories</a> about what makes a thing valuable. But I say that the value of a thing, is whatever someone is willing to pay for it. </p>

**Okay. What was the other thing you were gonna say that isn't wealth?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Slaves. </p>

**Oh, right. Makes sense...**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Right. People belong to themselves, so they can't be property. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> Anyway, I forgot to mention two big examples of wealth: wages and capital. </p>

**What are wages?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Wages are the reward for labor. </p>

**What is labor?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Labor is the exertion of human beings. </p>

**What is capital?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Capital is wealth that is used to produce more wealth. It is stored-up production. </p>

**What is production?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Production is the transformation of land, labor, and capital into wealth. </p>

**What is land?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Land is the natural world. </p>

**So the ocean is land?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Yes. </p>

**Outer space is land?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Yes. </p>

**wut**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Basically everything that isn't human beings or wealth, is land. Even the fish in the sea, the clouds in the sky, the gold veins in Earth's crust, the oil deep underground... it's all land. It's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_(economics)">"Economic Land"</a>. </p>

**Wait a minute, didn't you say that fish and gold are wealth?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> I said fish <em>that you've caught</em> and gold <em>that you've mined</em> are wealth. Remember, it can't be wealth if human labor hasn't been applied to it. </p>

**So if land is the natural world...**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Yes... </p>

**...and wealth is the product of human labor applied to the natural world...**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Yes... </p>

**...then that means that land is the source of all wealth!**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Bingo! </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> Now, let me ask you a question, going back to wages -- where do you think your wages come from? </p>

**They come from my employer. So I guess that would be my employer's capital.**

<p style="text-align: right;"> I see. And which do you think came first, labor or capital? </p>

**Well, capital is wealth, and wealth is the product of labor, so... labor came first?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> But if wages are the reward for labor and your wages come from someone's capital, wouldn't that mean that capital must come first? </p>

**This is hurting my brain.**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Okay, let's go back to a simple example, you catching fish. What are the land, labor, and capital in this example? </p>

**Okay. The land is the fish, before they are caught.**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Correct. </p>

**The labor is the effort I exert to catch the fish.**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Correct again. </p>

**The capital is... my fishing pole?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Uh... actually, I forgot to mention, you're trying to catch fish with your bare hands. </p>

**Okay, well... I guess there is no capital?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Exactly. So where do your wages come from? </p>

**Wait, what wages? I'm not working a job here... I'm just trying to catch fish, by myself, with my bare hands!**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Wages are the reward for your labor. What is the reward for your labor in this example? </p>

**Oh... the fish?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Correct. And where do they come from? </p>

**The natural world... well, and my labor.**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Exactly!!! Exactly. Wages come from production, not capital. Land and labor are necessary for production, but capital is not. </p>

**Okay, that makes sense in this simple example. But what about my job, where I'm paid with money?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Good question. In that case, you are still producing <em>something</em> of value for your employer. Think of that <em>something</em> as your initial wages, which you immediately exchange with your employer for money. </p>

**What about huge projects like power plants or cathedrals or ships? Isn't capital necessary in those cases?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> The wages are still drawn from production, no matter how much it costs or how long it takes. If it costs $100,000 to build a ship, then a ship that is 10% complete is basically worth $10,000, because it costs $90,000 to finish the 10% ship, which is $10,000 less than building a ship from nothing. So even if the boss pays laborers to build the ship, the boss's wealth is also increasing as the ship is brought closer and closer to completion. Thus the wages for building the ship are derived from the labor of building the ship. </p>

**Okay, fine. Wages come from production, not capital. So then what is capital for?!**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Capital increases the productivity of your labor. It can even unlock entire forms of production that would just be too impractical or risky without it. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> If I tried to build that ship on and off again, rather than saving up all the necessary capital up front and building it in one go, the ship would take longer to build, and it would probably need extra work to deal with any degradation from sitting idle, so it would probably cost more in the end. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> In other words, capital can limit the effectiveness of production, but it can't halt production itself. Even if there were no capital at all, people would still work, but they would just be much less productive. </p>

**If wages are the reward for labor, what is the reward for capital? And how are the rewards split between the two?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Oh, it's not just those two. There is also land. There are three factors of production, and each one has its own reward and its own law of distribution: </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> For <em>land</em>, there is the law of <em>rent</em>. </p>
<p style="text-align: right;"> For <em>labor</em>, there is the law of <em>wages</em>. </p>
<p style="text-align: right;"> For <em>capital</em>, there is the law of <em>interest</em>. </p>

**What is the law of rent?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Rent is the share of produced wealth that goes to the landowner for their exclusive right to use the land. </p>

**Is that like the rent I pay for my apartment each month?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> It's similar, but not exactly the same. It's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent">"Economic Rent"</a>. </p>

**oh my god**

<p style="text-align: right;"> And since it doesn't cost anything to use land, separate from labor and capital, any land rent is in excess of the true cost of production. </p>

**That sounds kinda... bad?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Yes it's pretty bad. </p>

**So how do you determine the price of land rent?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Let's say you could live in either (1) a small town where you can earn $10,000 per year or (2) a large city where you could earn $100,000 per year. Housing in the small town is so cheap it's basically free, but in the city you have to rent an apartment from me because I own the whole city. How much can I charge you for rent? </p>

**Well, if you charge me $90,000 per year then I'll have the same amount leftover as in the small town.**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Exactly. That $90,000 is called the <em>margin of production</em>, the difference between what you could earn here and the next best option. </p>

**But that's insane! You can't even qualify for an apartment if the rent is more than a third of your income!**

<p style="text-align: right;"> True. But it would also be pretty insane for one person to own an entire city. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> Now, suppose you find an even better job in the city, and now you can earn $110,000 per year. How much can I charge you for rent now? </p>

**$100,000, which means I still have... $10,000 leftover...**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Yeah. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> The value of land is determined by the opportunities that are available on it. As the opportunities increase, so does the land value, and the rent. </p>

**Well that's depressing.**

**Let's move on. What is the law of interest?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Interest is the return on capital. Capital receives its share of the rewards based on how much it increases productivity. Capitalists seek the highest risk-adjusted returns across all available opportunities. </p>

**Makes sense. What is the law of wages?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Wages are the return on labor. Laborers seek the highest wage for the least amount of effort. </p>

**I guess labor and capital are pretty similar in that regard.**

**Okay, so how do these three laws come together? How are the returns split between land, labor, and capital?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Where land is free and no capital is provided, all of the return goes to labor as wages. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> Where land is free and capital is provided, all of the return goes to labor as wages, except for the amount needed to make the investment of capital worthwhile. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> Where land is owned and subject to rent, the margin of production goes to the landowner as rent, while the rest is split between labor and capital as before. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> Where all land is owned, wages may be reduced by the competition of laborers to the minimum at which laborers will consent to reproduce. </p>

**"The minimum at which laborers will consent to reproduce?" That sounds pretty rough.**

<p style="text-align: right;"> For many people it is already a reality. </p>

**Also seems like landowners get an outsized portion of the returns.**

<p style="text-align: right;"> They do, and undeservedly so. Landowners receive their share of the return simply by owning land, not by working. The laborers provide their labor, and the capitalists provide their capital (which is stored-up labor), but the landowners receive all the excess wealth. </p>

**But what about societal progress? More people enter the workforce, technology improves, society just gets generally better... doesn't that help?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> For a little while, yes. But all of these things eventually cause land to become more valuable. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> More people? More demand for land. Land values go up. </p>
<p style="text-align: right;"> Better technology? People become more productive and produce more wealth. The places where they live become more desirable. Land values go up. </p>
<p style="text-align: right;"> Better social fabric? Places become more desirable. Land values go up. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> And let me ask you something. Now that you know that progress makes land more valuable, what do you think would be an easy way to make money in an up and coming area? </p>

**Buy empty land... and wait for it to become more valuable?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Exactly. And that's what people do. It's called land speculation. </p>

**Speculation... doesn't speculation always lead to a bubble that pops? Like the dot com bubble and the housing bubble?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Normally, yes. But land is special. As the saying goes, "land: they don't make it anymore". Because there is a fixed supply of land, and because land is so essential, it just keeps getting more valuable. </p>

**So, to sum everything up, I can't get ahead no matter what I do.**

<p style="text-align: right;"> That's putting it pretty bluntly, but basically yes. Unless you become a land speculator. </p>

**...**

<p style="text-align: right;"> I think we're ready to answer your original questions, if you'd like to ask them again. </p>

**Okay.**

**Why is there wealth inequality?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Wealth inequality is the inevitable result of land rent. Land is made valuable by all who live on and around it, but all of that value is captured by the one who owns it. As society advances forward, wages (adjusted for inflation) and return on capital remain the same, but land values and land rent always go up. Over time, these things lead naturally to the accumulation of most wealth into the hands of landowners. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> The framing of wealth inequality as a struggle between labor and capital is a distraction. Capital is not the problem -- it plays a vital role in creating wealth, just like labor -- <em>land rent is the problem</em>. Capitalists are exploitative only insofar as the land they own and collect rent on (which indeed many do), not the capital they invest into production. </p>

**Why do economic recessions happen?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Recessions, and depressions for that matter, are caused by the interplay between land rent and material progress. Every wave of progress (technological advancement, etc) brings an economic "boom", which makes everyone wealthier, which makes land more valuable, which allows landowners to demand more rent. Higher rent strains the economy by reducing wages and interest as low as possible, which eventually causes an economic "bust" as production stagnates, capital recedes, and laborers are laid off. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> Even through the worst depressions, there are always plenty of laborers ready to work, plenty of capital ready to be invested, and plenty of natural resources, yet all three remain idle because of prohibitively high land rent. It is one of the greatest and most tragic of ironies. </p>

**Why do wars happen?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> The principal concern of basically every war has been land. People seek wealth, and the source of all wealth is land. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> Everything you have ever bought was made by humans, or by machines that were themselves made by humans, and so on. Everything, except for land. You may have bought land from someone, and they may have bought it from someone before them. But at some point further back in history, someone simply claimed that land for themselves, and maybe fought others for it. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"> Land ownership has always been intertwined with violence. We may have managed to hide much of this violence with various institutions like laws and courts, but land is still the point at which human desires come into conflict. So long as landowners receive the margin of production, wars will be fought over land. </p>

**Why is the rent so damn high?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> Because the land is so damn valuable, and you don't own it. </p>

**So what's the solution? We take back the land?**

<p style="text-align: right;"> We don't need to take back the land. We just need to take back the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax"><em>land rent</em></a>. </p>
